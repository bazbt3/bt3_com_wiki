Trial of a dynamic image banner/masthead on the ADN Wiki main page.
----

- It should change to a predetermined set of criteria.
- Must establish the default size of images before preparing several which change on a recurring basis.

The criteria are not limited to e.g.:

1. 31 images changing by date,

2. 7 images changing by day,

3. 12 images changing by month,

4. Multiple images changing by day but with the option of different images encompassing exents occurring on the same day, e.g.    #bookclub, #thememonday, #mondaynightdanceparty.
   This *could* be achieved by having the images aligned to the right of the table and concatenated as required.

5. Space for special events overriding the above.
