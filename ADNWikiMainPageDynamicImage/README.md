Trial of a dynamic image banner/masthead, ultimately for the ADN Wiki main page.
----

- It should change subject to a predetermined set of criteria.
- Must establish the default size of images before preparing several which change on a recurring basis.

The criteria are not limited to e.g.:

1. 31 images changing by date,

2. 7 images changing by day,

3. 12 images changing by month,

4. Multiple images changing by day but with the option of different images encompassing exents occurring on the same day, e.g.    #bookclub, #thememonday, #mondaynightdanceparty.
   This *could* be achieved by having the images aligned to the right of the table and concatenated as required.

5. Provision for special events overriding the above.

First iteration:

The easiest thing to do - when creating a dynamic page - is to switch content simply by day-of-week. The first new design therefore chooses the regularly-repeating events from CurrentEvents and inserts a 'humorous' comment if no event exists.

A second iteration may check for #bookclub on the 15th day of every month.
