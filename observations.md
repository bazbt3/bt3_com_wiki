1. The obvious is not sometimes obvious. Branches are the key to successful revision control. Yes, I read the help.
2. README.md files won't display within a containing folder is they have a suffix added to 'README', e.g. 'READMEwontfix'. Fair enough, I know now.

Though I understand the process of revision control I'm currently unable to get it right.  The system's working for me but it's not a system that's in line with effective use of Github's tools.

For instance, though I know I should have probably copied (forked?) the CurrentEvents file (or created a new branch?) I failed utterly to do so.  I created CurrentEvents, deleted the stuff I didn't need, messed up the file's transition to a new folder, renamed it ('essentials') and created a new 'original' file to retain the original state.  Messy isn't it.

I'm also not using the Windows or command-line tools - I baulked at my email address being attached to commits.  Odd, seeing that it's available with only the most casual of Google searches.  (The illusion of privacy sometimes overrides all logic.)
