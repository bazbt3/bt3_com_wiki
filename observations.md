Though I understand the process of revision control I'm currently unable to get it right.  The system's working for me but it's not a system that's in line effective use of Github's tools.

For instance, though I know I should have probably copied (forked?) the CurrentEvents file (or created a new branch) I failed utterly to do so.  I created CurrentEvents, deleted the stuff I didn't need, messed up the file's transition to a new folder, renamed it ('essentials') and created a new 'original' file to retain the original state.  Messy isn't it.
