============

Testing GitHub - can my site's Mediawiki pages' markup iterations be controlled here?

There's not likely to be anything interesting for other individuals here. bt3.com - my site's main focus has so far been testing 'stuff' for the App.net Wiki (appdotnetwiki.net).

The first addition here was the CurrentEvents page - which has a particularly naughty bug in the code used to display This Week's and Next Week's #thememonday entries in the table. This is almost certainly due to my lack of application of sound mathematical principles whilst working within the restrictions imposed by Mediawiki Markup.

The problem with the page is not so much the bugs but my enthusiasm - editing a Wiki page which has hard-to-follow code won't be easy for third-parties. CurrentEvents therefore shall be relegated to Won't Fix status.

If this language is tortuous-enough to put you off reading now, then my work is done.
