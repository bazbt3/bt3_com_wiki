bt3_com_wiki
----

I've proved that I can control the markup iterations for my site [(bt3.com)](http://www.bt3.com/) here.

There's not likely to be anything interesting for other individuals here. My site has as its main focus testing 'stuff' for the [App.net Wiki](http://appdotnetwiki.net).

The first addition here was the [CurrentEvents page](http://bt3.com/index.php?title=CurrentEvents) - which still has a particularly naughty bug in the code used to display This Week's and Next Week's #thememonday entries in the table. This is almost certainly due to my lack of application of sound mathematical principles whilst working within the restrictions imposed by Mediawiki Markup. The problem with the page is not so much the bugs but my enthusiasm - editing a Wiki page which has hard-to-follow code won't be easy for third-parties. CurrentEvents therefore shall be relegated to Won't Fix status (see the [wontfix](https://github.com/bazbt3/bt3_com_wiki/tree/master/wontfix) folder).

If this language is tortuous-enough to put you off reading now, then my work is done.
