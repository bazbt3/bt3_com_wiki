<br>It uses code like the following, the middle is removed for brevity:
<pre>
{{#switch: {{CURRENTDAY}}
 |0=Something went wrong. Bend over.
 |1=What's happening? [[App.Net_Wiki:Current_events|This is.]]
 ...
 |31=The App.net Wiki has [[Pages_that_need_work|pages that need work.]]
 |32=Something went wrong. Hands up!
}}
</pre>
The 'switch' command uses a system variable 'CURRENTDAY' and looks through a list of entries starting with a "|" and a number which corresponds to the CURRENTDAY of the month. '0' and '32' are superfluous.
