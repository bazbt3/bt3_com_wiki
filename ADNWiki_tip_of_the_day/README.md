A possible tip of the day
=========================

Will a tip-of-the day/week/month be useful and/or popular at the ADN Wiki?

As a trial example, choose a 31-day month, create a few arbitrary items for display, and then transclude the resulting tip-of-the-day into the Wiki's main page.

See the base of column 2 at http://bt3.com for a rough implementation, and http://bt3.com/index.php?title=QotD for the code. (To see the latest version of the full code, view the source.)
